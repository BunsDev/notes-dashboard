# Notes Dashboard

Developers often need to quickly reference their personal notes during interviews, live streams, meetings, or pair programming sessions. While existing tools like Notion, Google Keep, and Evernote offer rich note-taking experiences, they can be overkill or slow to access in high-pressure situations. This notes application is being developed to provide a lightweight, fast-access, web-based dashboard tailored specifically for developers. It emphasizes speed, simplicity, and easy categorization for context-specific note-taking.
